The first folder here has a list of all the documents for an equity transaction.  You can see them one at a time (by following instructions).  The second folder is the deal terms.  All the terms for the deal are in a single file, which references the parties and states deal points.  It also has little patches for adjusting the various documents.  That way, everything is in the same place, compact and machine readable.  Good for doing other deals.
